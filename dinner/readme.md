# Crunchy Southwestern Chicken Wrap

## Servings: 
4 servings
## Time to prepare:
Total time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients:
SAUCE
- 3/4 cup sour cream
- 3/4 cup salsa
- 1 1/2 tablespoons taco seasoning
WRAPS
- 4 large tortillas (wrap size)
- 1 1/3 cups shredded lettuce
- 1/2 cup tomato, diced
- 1 whole avocado, diced
- 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
- 2 cups cooked chicken, shredded
- 1 cup Fritos, crushed

## Equipment needed:
-Mixing bowl
-Cutting board
-Measuring cups and spoons
-Knife

## Steps for preparation:

**- Make the sauce**: Put the salsa, sour cream, and taco seasoning in a bowl, and mix them together.

**- Sauce the tortilla**: Lay a tortilla on your cutting board and spread sauce over the bottom half. Leave a dry border around the edge of the tortilla.

**- Add the ingredients**: Place the lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, cheese, and chicken on top of the sauce. Then crush Fritos over the top of the wrap, and drizzle more sauce on top.

**- Fold**: Fold in the sides of the tortilla and roll it tightly. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas, and cut in half before serving. 

### Notes / Tips:

**- Adjust the sauce to your spice level**: This sauce has a little bit of a kick to it from the salsa and taco seasoning. If you’re a big fan of spice, add more of those ingredients, or use a spicier salsa. If you’re not a fan of heat, use less salsa. 

**- Roll them tight**: Make sure to roll these wraps very tightly when you fold them. Wraps that aren’t rolled tightly might fall apart when you eat them.

**- Use extra ripe avocados**: These wraps are all about texture. The sauce is creamy, the chicken is juicy, and the Fritos are crunchy. Be sure to use avocados that are super ripe. Unripe avocados have a chewy and stringy texture that you don’t want in these wraps.
